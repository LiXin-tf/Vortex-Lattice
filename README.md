Here are movies in the article 'Generation of vortices and stabilization of vortex lattices in holographic superfluids'.


VL7_above.gif shows process for formation of the lattice consisting of 7 vortices. In this gif, the above viewpoint is adpoted, so it's easier to understand the whole evolution from generation of vortices to formation of corresponding lattice.

VL7_boxed.gif shows process for formation of the lattice consisting of 7 vortices. In this gif, boxes are reserved, so it's easier to see variation of order parameter in the time evolution.

VL19_above.gif shows process for formation of the lattice consisting of 19 vortices with above viewpoint.

VL19_boxed.gif shows process for formation of the lattice consisting of 19 vortices with boxes reserved.
